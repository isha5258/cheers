## Motivation
<br>

With breweries endlessly opening and producing more and more different beers, I wanted to create a mobile app that allowed users to post beers they are drinking. While the idea was inspired by Untapped, I wanted to take what I have learned about Python, PostgreSQL, and Flask to create an app that friends and family (+21) could enjoy.
