      <p class="p">With the vastly growing microbrewery industry and endlessly rotating beers on tap at your favorite breweries, keeping track of what you like or even what you had two weeks ago can be tough. Allow Cheers to keep track of your beer posts. Cheers will let you track your posts and view posts from other users as well.
      </p>
      <p class="p"> You will notice while you are posting a new beer that there is not a rating system. This was intentional. A rating can be very subjective, and while one type of beer may not be to someones liking such as IPAs, stouts, etc, we don't want that to affect the overall rating of the beer. Instead, we opted for just a comment section that we encourage all users to utilize to describe what they liked or disliked about the beer and brewery.</p>
      <p class="p3">Begin tracking your beers today!</p>
